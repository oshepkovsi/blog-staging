Even if you only buy or sell cryptocurrency, they are not the only options investors can use crypto for. Every beholder of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can use it to purchase goods, pay for services, donate to charity, or even tip. 

So, if you think about where to spend your crypto, this article will tell you about apps, companies, and services that accept crypto as payment.

## Ways To Spend Crypto

There are several ways how people can use crypto, such as: 

* Buying something online (e.g., on marketplaces)
* Give tips 
* Donate to charity supporting funds
* Buy something using card gifts, for example, Amazon Cards
* Paying for hotels and accommodation while traveling
* Spending crypto on video games and many others

### **Tips**

To thank someone with bitcoin is easy. For example, [Tippin. me](https://tippin.me/) is now one of the simplest ways to send and receive bitcoin tips on Twitter. [CoinTip](https://cointip.jp/en/) is another alternative for tipping on Twitter, as it operates via a dashboard that is accessible after setting up a CoinTip account and depositing Bitcoin into it.

### **Gift Cards**

Gift cards can be an excellent present for friends and family. Big giants, such as Amazon, BestBuy, and dozens of smaller companies, offer gift cards to be purchased in crypto. Several services can help you: 

* [Coingate Gift Cards](https://coingate.com/gift-cards)
* [Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/?hl=en)
* [BitPay Gift Cards](https://bitpay.com/gift-cards/)

### **Video Games**

Companies like Microsoft have recently started offering games or pre-order video games and other apps for bitcoin. Others like this Minecraft Server are even using the bitcoin network to power their in-game currency. 

[BitPay](http://btfreelancer.net/) is also one of the most well-known platforms that accept crypto payments. Users can buy games with bitcoin via the BitPay app by topping their cards up with funds and then buying games or gaming gift cards via any vendor that accepts BitPay at checkout.

Another company that allows buying gaming gift cards with cryptocurrency is [Keys4Coins.](https://www.keys4coins.com/) The platform accepts a range of different cryptos, including bitcoin.

### **Food** 

Whole Foods, Starbucks, and Home Depot, the largest hardware store chain in the United States, are food and restaurant companies daring enough to accept crypto payments. 

### **Travel**

Love traveling? The great news is that you can pay for hotels and accommodation with [Expedia](http://viewfinder.expedia.com/features/expedia-embraces-bitcoin) or book a flight with [CheapAir](http://www.cheapair.com/blog/travel-news/book-your-flights-on-cheapair-with-bitcoin-virtual-currency) or BalticAir. [Car dealerships](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/buying-cars-bitcoin-lamborghini-jeep-everything) are also trying to keep up, and while paying for fuel directly with bitcoin has yet to happen, Tesla accepted bitcoin as a payment starting in early 2021.

### **Donate on charity** 

Apart from buying stuff, you can help others by choosing the fund you want to support. 

Hundreds of charity funds accept cryptocurrency nowadays, for example, [UNICEF CryptoFund](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/stories/unicef-cryptofund), [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/donation.aspx), or Syria and Turkey Earthquake Emergency [Response Fund.](https://thegivingblock.com/campaigns/syria-turkey-emergency-response-fund/)

## What Are Crypto Debit Cards?

To spend your crypto conveniently, you may need a crypto debit card, which is a type of card from Visa and Mastercard used to convert your crypto balance into fiat (such as USD) to make purchases.

This card lets you spend your crypto balance at any shop or an app that accepts Visa and Mastercard. Crypto companies such as Coinbase, Crypto.com, BitPay, and others provide crypto debit cards.

Another advantage of a crypto debit card is that it often has a cashback program - the provider can return between 1-8% of the billed amount in crypto. Some also have reward programs for streaming services or other offers, while others waive card ATM fees. 

As for the cons of such cards, they still need to be globally accepted, and you also should be very careful with taxes in your country.
