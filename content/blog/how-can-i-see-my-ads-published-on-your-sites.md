Unfortunately, it is not easy to locate your ad on our publishersâ€™ sites, because the process of ad selection is probabilistic.


But usually, it is still possible:

1. Go to your "Campaign -> Traffic sources -> Exclude from campaign" page and see a list of ad units that generate traffic for your campaign (sorted by non-unique clicks).
2. Click any of the ad units and check its campaigns at the Ad Unit -> Campaigns page. Here you should be able to find your campaign and the percentage of traffic bought by it. But if you don't - then probably your ad is no longer displayed on the ad unit, please check another one a similar way.
3. Go to the ad unit's site and reload it until you see your ad.


Please make sure your browser language matches your country, and ad language, otherwise, you won't see the ad.
