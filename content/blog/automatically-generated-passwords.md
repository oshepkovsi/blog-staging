Many of our users tend to reuse their passwords on multiple sites. Unfortunately, sometimes such passwords get leaked and become publicly available. There have been several incidents where hackers have managed to get into other users' accounts.

The last time that happened, we reset the passwords of the compromised accounts and asked their owners to set new passwords. Unfortunately, many of them set the same passwords again!

To prevent such a situation in the future, starting today, A-ADS generates unique passwords for new users.

Old passwords have been selectively revoked. If you cannot log in with your old password, please request a new one using [this link](https://a-ads.com/user/password/new).
