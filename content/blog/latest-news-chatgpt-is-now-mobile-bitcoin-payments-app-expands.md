## Bitcoin Payments App Strike Expands to Over 65 Countries

Bitcoin payments app, [Strike](https://strike.me/), led by CEO Jack Mallers, is expanding its reach from the U.S. to over 65 countries. This announcement came during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Florida. Strike utilises Bitcoin and Lightning, a secondary network for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions, to provide global payment and cross-border money transfer services. The app has been redesigned with a new user interface and now allows users to hold funds in Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).

This expansion significantly increases Strike's addressable market to nearly 3 billion people! To improve the user experience, Strike has focused on enhancing the app's onboarding process, particularly for users outside the United States, where app design standards may vary.

The main goal of Strike is to facilitate Bitcoin transactions and cross-border payments for individuals in Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean.
