### 2. VPN Subscription

With plenty of restrictions and data leaks on the internet, it can be a safe idea to present your friends with a secure and convenient VPN subscription. 

### 3. CryptoSteel Capsule

A solid steel capsule helps to protect a 24-word recovery phrase. As the recovery Phrase is the only backup of your crypto assets, this capsule keeps your word even under extreme conditions. This present is fantastic for those who are anxious about password security. 

You can check several shops to find the one you like, for example, [LEDGER Shop](https://shop.ledger.com/products/cryptosteel-capsule-solo) or [TREZOR.](https://trezor.io/accessories/cryptosteel-capsule-solo) 

### 4. Bitcoin Price Ticker

If your friends check cryptocurrency prices throughout the day, they will probably benefit from a dedicated cryptocurrency price ticker. You can find a great [variety](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Ticker-Crypto-Cryptocurrency-tracker/dp/B09KMRLP52) on many marketplaces, such as Amazon.

You can choose a cryptocurrency you want to present to your loved ones and buy a gift card. Then, send the gift card's details to the recipient.

## Funny crypto gifts

### 1. NFT Mystery Boxes 

For extra fun, you can present a [Mystery Box](https://www.binance.com/en/nft/mystery-box?ref=VJ9G6UC4) to your friend, which no one knows the contents of until they've unwrapped it. After all, half of the Christmas fun's the unboxing, isn't it?

An NFT mystery box is similar to a physical box. Inside it, you can find a random NFT from a specific NFT collection. Usually, an NFT mystery box features NFTs with different rarity levels. You can get a quite rare NFT that sells for thousands or millions of dollars if you are lucky. If not, you will probably get a common NFT that most people also have in their collections.

Pick out your gift from one of the largest [NFT marketplaces](https://nft.binance.com/en?ref=VJ9G6UC4), for example, [Binance Marketplace](https://www.binance.com/en/nft/blindBox/market). 

### 2. Crypto Stickers

Crypto stickers are a great way to give your friend the perfect introduction to the world of crypto. Whether they're blockchain and crypto fanatics or just an average laptop user, let them deck out their tech, notebooks, skateboard, or anything else with these fantastic [crypto stickers](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/crypto+stickers). You can pick up a set on [Redbubble,](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/crypto+stickers) [Etsy,](https://www.etsy.com/market/crypto_sticker) or [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/crypto-stickers).

## Crypto For Philanthropists 

If you know someone whose philosophy is to give rather than take, why not donate in your friend's name? Giving back to the community can also be a present that will definitely be well-received. Make a meaningful contribution to [non-profit organizations](https://www.binance.charity/?ref=VJ9G6UC4) that allow you to donate via cryptocurrencies and offer aid to the needy in this season of giving.

Organizations like the [Albert Einstein College of Medicine](https://www.einsteinmed.edu/), [American Cancer Society, Inc](https://www.cancer.org/), [Code.org](https://bitpay.com/blog/how-to-donate-crypto/Code.org), or [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, Inc.](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/) accept crypto donations. This [article](https://bitpay.com/blog/how-to-donate-crypto/) explains how to donate crypto to non-profit organizations. 

No matter what gift you choose, time spent with your loved ones is the most precious gift. Happy Holidays!
