Learn-to-earn programs offer an excellent opportunity for cryptocurrency beginners to enter the world of digital currencies. These programs provide educational resources and support for those interested in learning more about crypto investing. The best part is that you don't need special qualifications or prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies to start.


So let's dive in and explore this exciting opportunity! This article will examine learn-to-earn programs, how they work, and where to start. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a curious beginner, you'll find valuable insights and tips to help you get started in the exciting crypto world.

## Learn and Earn Crypto: What are They?

Learn-to-earn crypto is an excellent way to earn cryptocurrency while learning about it. Not only can you expand your knowledge of cryptocurrencies, but you can also make some free money in the process. Platforms like Coinbase Earn or Binance Academy offer free tokens for completing specific tasks or quizzes. To participate, you need to create an account and verify your identity. Once you do that, you'll be able to access a variety of tasks and quizzes of varying difficulty and length. But if you complete them, you'll earn free crypto!

It is a win-win situation for both crypto users and projects. Users can learn new concepts and earn crypto rewards, while projects can promote their coins/tokens and reach more people. Task duration and reward amounts vary among different projects and platforms, but on average, expect to earn $5–$10 after completing 15–30 minutes of tasks.

Some programs also offer airdrops, where users who successfully finish tasks related to upcoming projects receive early investments with huge potential to grow in the future. To make the most of these opportunities, stay updated on announcements and related sections in exchanges or websites, subscribe to alerts and be aware of scammers or fake programs.

Earning crypto through learn-and-earn programs is a safe and almost risk-free method of making money. It's an exciting approach that complements other promising methods of earning money on top of your investments. 

## What Cryptocurrencies Can Be Earned?

The type of cryptocurrency you can earn through play-to-earn games varies depending on the game itself.

For instance, the popular game [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com) enables players to earn their native currency, AXS, and SLP (Small Love Potion) tokens. In contrast, [Splinterlands](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Splinterlands&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) rewards players with its in-game token, DEC.

Other games like [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) and [My Neighbor Alice](https://www.myneighboralice.com) offer their unique tokens, SAND, and ALICE, respectively, as rewards for players. Some games even allow players to earn NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that can be sold for cryptocurrencies.
