A-ADS (former "Anonymous Ads") is the first privacy-focused bitcoin-based advertising network, founded in 2011. 

## Crypto advertising made easier

It takes less than a minute to start your anonymous advertising campaign or create an anonymous ad unit. Your personal data is safe - we simply don’t need it.

We bring you an extensive selection of traffic sources which are perfect for promotion of ICOs, FinTech crypto-related services, crypto-exchanges and Trading, Cloud Mining, Gaming, Gambling and Blockchain projects.

We accept deposits in Bitcoin and a number of altcoins including Ripple, Binance Coin, Bitcoin SV, Tether, NEO, Ether Classic, Tron, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, ZCash, NEM and Waves. The number of supported coins is growing.

We offer Pay-per-Day (CPD) and Pay-for-Result (CPA + RS) models which you can mix in one campaign, as well as text and graphic banner ads in most popular languages. You can create your CPD campaign [here](https://a-ads.com/campaigns/new) or contact our helpdesk to discuss CPA opportunities.
