What could be better than some crypto in the wallet? Only the crypto that you got for free! Several years ago, mining was the only way to earn some cryptocurrency; today, that has changed. As apps and dapps become more popular, people are looking for more ways to earn crypto.

As soon as such apps emerged, they flooded the market. Some of them can help you to make some coins for playing games, while others motivate you to do some simple tasks in exchange for a bit of crypto.

Want to learn more about these apps? Let's first check out how they work.

## How To Earn Crypto With An App

To know how these apps work, let's first look at one of the most well-known apps for earning digital currency - [Sweatcoin](https://sweatco.in). This app was a pure outbreak among other apps and became extremely popular quickly. The app said that all you need are legs to earn some crypto. Yep, just walking. You can make a new digital currency called Sweatcoin whenever you want to take a stroll outside. 

As you walk, the app clocks in on your footwork on a mobile device. Every 1,000 steps are 0.95 Sweatcoins. You can cash out on Paypal, spend the coins on offers from sponsors, or buy Amazon gift cards with them.

As for the pitfalls, the app can drain the battery quickly, and the prizes earn slowly. But it's still an excellent app if you want to get some stuff for free and are a fan of long strolls.

That is just one example. There are other good fish in the sea. Some apps allow you to earn cryptocurrency through mini-tasks. For instance, [BitGigs](https://bitgigs.com) or [Freelanceforcoins.com](https://freelanceforcoins.com/projects) are popular freelancer marketplaces to pay their workers in bitcoin.

Let's explore other opportunities for earning free cryptocurrency.

## Best Apps To Earn Free Crypto

The following overview of the best crypto apps in the market will help you to choose the ones that suit you. 

* ### **[ eToro](https://www.etoro.com/en-us/)**

It was named the best crypto app for 2022 and had some reasons for it. This provider is regulated by the SEC and the FCA in the United Kingdom, ASIC in Australia, and CySEC in Cyprus. These regulations mean you can trade cryptocurrency safely on your cell phone without worrying about security. eToro includes around 50 cryptocurrencies, which is just great! The app is also super user-friendly, so it is easy to use.

You can trade any crypto that is supported by the crypto market on the eToro app spread-only basis. This starts at just 0.75%, which is very competitive. You shouldn't pay any fees on deposits in US dollars, and the app supports many payment methods. US clients are most lucky cuz' they can deposit their funds at a minimum of just $10.

Plus, eToro is fantastic for its passive investment tools, which include a copy trading feature where you can mirror the crypto-investments of a seasoned day trader. You can also invest in a diversified crypto portfolio; the eToro team manages this.

* ### **DeFi Swap** 

This app stands out as the best-decentralized crypto app and is also well known for being pretty user-friendly. DeFi Swap leverages the power of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and offers to swap tokens and generate interest without any intermediary. Using DeFi Swap, you can connect your wallets directly to the platform and later swap tokens through liquidity pools. What's more is that the app offers staking, swapping, and yield farming services without the need to verify or do complete KYC checks. 

The app has no complicated features or specified advanced jargon, making it easier to use. It also has more than 50+ cryptocurrencies to choose from. Plus, users can invest in the exchange's native token called DeFi Coin (DEFC).

* ### **[Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/mobile/)**

This app is one of the oldest crypto exchanges in the world. You can choose from 50 different cryptos, including major coins like BTC and ETH. Compared with other apps, this one maintains a relatively low-cost approach, with only 0.5% per trade. Plus, fees are reduced to 0.25% if you exceed $10,000 in monthly trading volume. Another feature is that Bitstamp's app has biometric authentication to provide security, keeping 98% of customer assets in cold storage. All of that makes trade secure.

* ### **[Aqru](https://aqru.io)**

Now, let's have a look at something different. Aqru stands out from the crowd simply cuz' it doesn't specialize in trading services but focuses on earning interest. So if you merely put your coins in depositing into the secure Aqru app, you will be paid a super-attractive APY of 7%.

What's good is that with Aqru, you don't need to agree to a minimum redemption period. You can withdraw your tokens at any time without paying any penalty. Plus, there is no requirement to stake any tokens to get the 7% rate on the offer.

As for the minimum deposit, you need $100 to start with. Technical knowledge of digital currencies is not so necessary, as the app guides you through the interest-earning process step-by-step. The app is user-friendly, has a pretty good mobile app, and is perfect for beginners. And finally, interest is calculated daily.

* ### **[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/eea)**

This app's core feature is the opportunity to buy coins using a debit card. Crypto.com is probably one of the best crypto apps and altcoin exchangers. The app offers over 250+ digital assets. And you can easily purchase any of these assets with Visa or MasterCard at a fee of 2.99%. How to do it? First, you must open an account and go through a quick KYC process.

Another nice feature is that crypto.com allows users to create their diversified portfolios. The crypto.com app supports bank transfers and debit cards and offers its own crypto credit card.

Another nice feature of this app is that you can put some of your digital assets into a savings account, and you will be paid a rate of interest. The app charges 0.40% when you place a buy order and again when you cash out. 

* ### **[Nebeus](https://nebeus.com)**

Nebeus is not just an app; it is a complete crypto ecosystem with an intuitive and modern interface. This service supports 20+ coins, but Nebeus is adding new cryptos monthly to its platform and integrating them into all its benefits.

What else? It is worth mentioning that Nebeus' earning programs are among the most competitive in the market right now, providing a 6.5% APY in crypto and 12.85% APY in stablecoins. It is user-friendly, with both mobile and desktop platforms. Plus, it has free crypto transfers to other Nebeus users, which is convenient. The minimum deposit depends on the selected method and could be between €0-50.

* ### **Coinbase** 

Do you want to know what app is best for newbies in crypto? That is Coinbase. This app is arguably one of the best crypto apps for new investors with little to no experience investing in digital assets. By the way, it offers more than 100+ coins. New users receive guided support on buying, storing, and selling their assets. No minimum deposit is required.

Coinbase has a range of security tools. To use the app, you need to enter your chosen PIN, plus two-factor authentication will need to be passed via a code sent to your phone via SMS. Cold storage is another crucial safeguard that Coinbase offers. And last but not least, Coinbase also allows you to lock withdrawal requests for 48 hours which serves for better security. 

* ### **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)**

In spite of having some problems recently, this app is still a great app for buying and selling digital assets regularly. Binance offers around 1,000 trading markets covering a wide variety of assets. Thus, if you find a good investment opportunity, you'll most likely find it on the app. What's more, is that Binance offers meager trading commissions. You will pay around 0.10% per slide, so that's $10 for every $1,000 traded. For active traders, the rates will be even more attractive. And finally, Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange for volume and liquidity. 

This will depend on your location for getting started with the Binance app.  

* ### **[Blockfolio ](https://blockfolio.com)**

This app is free of charge for iOS and Android and is used as a piece of mobile news and portfolio tracking app for cryptocurrencies. Let's explore its features. First, using Blockfolio, you can import data about your crypto positions from different exchange platforms. The app has enough tools to visualize your positions, track your profit and loss over time, and much more. Second, you can set up multiple portfolios, separating your investment goals easily. The app also allows users to view real-time price charts and news.
