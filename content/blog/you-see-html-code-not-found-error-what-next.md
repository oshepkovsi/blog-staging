## Default error

So, you’ve got an error message saying that your ad unit code is not found. This error seriously reduces your earnings and needs to be fixed. 

![HTML code not found](../../static/assets/1htmlcodenotfound.jpg "HTML code not found")

If you see this message alone, this means that our bot cannot find the ad unit at the specified URL. 

An ad unit must be present on that very page you specified for it in the ad unit settings, as our bot doesn't search through all your site pages to find the ad unit, it checks only the specified page. So first of all, check if the ad unit is present right at the specified URL.

We often show one more info message below this one. It describes the exact reason why your ad unit is not found (even despite the ad unit code present at the specified URL). Here’re the most popular problems and possible fixes:

## Timeout error

![Timeout error](../../static/assets/01timeouterror.jpg "Timeout error")

Your site takes too long to respond. 

## Unavailable site

![Site unavailable error](../../static/assets/3unavailable.jpg "Site unavailable error")

Your site cannot be loaded with a browser at all, e.g. it might be offline.

## Page cannot be loaded

![Page cannot be loaded error](../../static/assets/4pagecannotbeloaded.jpg "Page cannot be loaded error")

The error appears when a website can be opened in a browser, but its source code cannot be analyzed by our bot program because of incorrect site settings. The possible reasons are as follows:

* A site page keeps reloading
* A site has an endless page
* A site database is not configured
* A domain name is not registered
* A site forbids VPN, proxy, Tor, etc.

## Redirecting to another website

![Redirecting to another website error](../../static/assets/5redirecting.jpg "Redirecting to another website error")

An ad unit must be present on the URL specified for it on the ad unit page. You get the “Redirecting to another website” error, if this URL redirects to some other domain. 

To fix the error you can either remove redirect, or change the URL of the ad unit on the ad unit page at a-ads.com. You can edit the ad unit URL via the link on the ad unit page:

![Edit the ad unit URL](../../static/assets/editpage.png "Edit the ad unit URL")

Mind, if your ad unit had been found on the old URL before, you won’t be able to change the URL yourself, you’ll need help from our support team to do it.

If you cannot fix the problem, just abandon this ad unit and create a new one. :)

## Missing URL

![Missing URL error](../../static/assets/7miurl.jpg "Missing URL error")

This error appears if src attribute of the iframe tag is absent or is empty. This can happen e.g. if you have edited your ad unit code and occasionally removed the src attribute. 

In case you add a URL into src attribute with JavaScript, it’s possible that it is not added in due time, so the bot will define the URL as empty.

A correct src attribute looks like this:

![A correct src attribute](../../static/assets/pasted-image-3.png "A correct src attribute")

## Invalid URL

![Invalid URL error](../../static/assets/8invalidurl.jpg "Invalid URL error")

Attribute src should contain a normalized URL. If a URL is not normalized, you’ll get this error message. 

You can check if the URL is correct by copy-pasting it into browser address bar - a banner should be displayed. E.g. you copy this:

![Check correct URL](../../static/assets/unnamed.png "Check correct URL")

And see a banner:

![Correct URL example advert](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.35.29.png "Correct URL example advert")

So, the URL in the src attribute is correct.

Here are examples of invalid URLs:

![Examples of invalid URL](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.35.46.png "Examples of invalid URL")

![Examples of invalid URL](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.36.08.png "Examples of invalid URL")

![Examples of invalid URL](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.36.16.png "Examples of invalid URL")

![Examples of invalid URL](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.36.29.png "Examples of invalid URL")

The last URL is also invalid, because it contains space symbols and an ad cannot be loaded for this reason.

## Alert or pop-up message is blocking your ad

![Alert or pop-up message is blocking your ad error](../../static/assets/9alertorpopup.jpg "Alert or pop-up message is blocking your ad error")

The bot normally can verify an ad unit in spite of alert, confirm and prompt windows on your site page. In cases when it cannot cope with this sort of pop-up, you get this error. 

Pop-ups blocking a banner might look like this:

![Pop-ups blocking a banner example](../../static/assets/16.png "Pop-ups blocking a banner example")

![Pop-ups blocking a banner example](../../static/assets/17.png "Pop-ups blocking a banner example")

## Ad is not fully visible

![Ad is not fully visible error](../../static/assets/10adnotfully.jpg "Ad is not fully visible error")

You get this message if an ad on your site is not fully visible. A banner is present in the site code, but is partly or fully hidden by some other page elements. If banners overlap each other, you’ll get this error too.

![Overlapping banner example](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.54.45.png "Overlapping banner example")

![Overlapping banner example](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.54.59.png "Overlapping banner example")

If you place a floating ad that can be closed, the “Close” button should not overlap it, else you’ll also get this error. Here is an example of proper placement of a button: 

![Example of proper placement of a button](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-2.37.01.png "Example of proper placement of a button")

And here is the wrong way: 

![Example of wrong placement of a button](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-2.37.21.png "Example of wrong placement of a button")

The "Ad is not fully visible" error might also be caused by a pop-up window that appears while loading a site. Prompt, alert, and confirm windows normally don't cause an error or cause another error. :)
If you can avoid pop-up ads, you'd better not use them. 


Another probable reason for the error is that your banners are loaded later than your site.


Suppose the ad unit on your site is placed correctly but doesn't appear immediately after loading. In that case, our bot may consider it invisible, blocked by another element, inaccessible for clicks, or undetected. Please get in touch with our support team in this case - we'll fix the error.

## Ad is unclickable

![Ad is unclickable error](../../static/assets/11unclickable.jpg "Ad is unclickable error")

A banner must be clickable. A click must lead to the advertised site. If nothing happens after a click, or if it leads to some other site, the error appears.

## Invalid domain

![Invalid domain errror](../../static/assets/111invaliddomain.jpg "Invalid domain errror")

The src attribute must contain one of a-ads.com domains. On the moment two domains are allowed: ad.a-ads.com and acceptable.a-ads.com . If the src attribute contains any other domain, you’ll get this message.

## Empty data-aa

![Empty data-aa error](../../static/assets/13emptydataaa.jpg "Empty data-aa error")

The error appears if there’s no data-aa attribute in the iframe. A correct iframe with data-aa attribute looks like this:

![Correct iframe with data-aa attribute](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.59.06.png "Correct iframe with data-aa attribute")

An erroneous iframe:

![Incorrect iframe with data-aa attribute](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-1.59.22.png "Incorrect iframe with data-aa attribute")

## Empty ID

![Empty ID error](../../static/assets/14emptyid.jpg "Empty ID error")

An ad unit ID must be present in the src attribute of the iframe tag in your site source code. The ID is expected to be after the first slash sign “/” following the domain (ad.a-ads.com or acceptable.a-ads.com). A correct code piece looks like:

![A correct code piece with ID](../../static/assets/empty1.5.png "A correct code piece with ID")

This one is incorrect, because an ID is absent in src attribute:

![An incorrect code piece with ID](../../static/assets/empty2.png "An incorrect code piece with ID")

An ID is also expected to be before the next slash or further params, e.g. “?size=240x400”. That’s why ID is regarded empty in the following case as well:

![An incorrect code piece with ID](../../static/assets/empty3.png "An incorrect code piece with ID")

## Invalid ID

![Invalid ID error](../../static/assets/15invalidid.jpg "Invalid ID error")

This error means you’ve got one ad unit ID in the src attribute and another ID in the data-aa attribute in the iframe tag embedded into your site source code.

![An incorrect code piece with multiple IDs](../../static/assets/снимок-экрана-2019-07-08-в-2.01.58.png "An incorrect code piece with multiple IDs")

## Size doesn’t match

An ad unit can be adaptive or have a fixed size. 

The minimum allowed size for an adaptive ad unit is 120x25 px. If a banner on your site page is less, you’ll get an error message:

![Size doesn’t match error](../../static/assets/размерdontmatch.jpg "Size doesn’t match error")

If your ad unit is a fixed size one, the banner on your site page should match ad unit exact size, else you’ll get an error message:

![Size doesn’t match error](../../static/assets/размерdontmatchдва.jpg "Size doesn’t match error")

To fix the error, you should adjust an actual size of a banner with the requirements. The required size for your banner is present in the text of the error message (the second size of the two). The first size in the error message will be the actual size of a banner on your site.

## Cloudflare denies access

![Cloudflare denies access error](../../static/assets/cloudflare_detected.png "Cloudflare denies access error")

Cloudflare prevents our bot from accessing your site. To fix this, please whitelist our server IPs. You can address support to know the IPs to add.

## Unknown error

![Unknown error](../../static/assets/unknonerror.jpg "Unknown error")

An unexpected error occurred, and we cannot identify its origin. It might disappear on its own or remain, so you should contact our helpdesk.

## Conclusion

If the issue is likely on your side, we encourage you to find the solution before you address the support. You can run our bot after you've fixed the issue to see if the error has disappeared.

![Check embedded HTML code button](../../static/assets/checkcode.png "Check embedded HTML code button")
