Google Chrome developers have recently <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/05/heavy-ad-interventions" rel="nofollow">introduced new limitations in terms of displaying ads to the user</a>. For instance, the ads that create a very high network or processor load will be blocked and never shown.

The A-ADS network has always strived to be as simple and unobtrusive as possible, so we have the following advantages over the competing advertising networks:

* We do not let advertisers use JavaScript: only text or image ads are allowed, which means the user CPU is never stressed
* Image-based ads are limited to less than one megabyte which is well below the limits outlined by Google (four megabytes)
* Our ad delivery servers are well optimized and send data to the user at the highest possible speeds.

As an advertiser, you can be sure that users will see your ads.

Google Chrome is one of the most popular Internet browsers, and A-ADS principles are fully compliant with the new browser limitations.
