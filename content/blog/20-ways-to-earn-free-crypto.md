Earning some free cryptocurrency is easier than it may seem. There are plenty of opportunities for you to choose from. Exchanges and platforms offer plenty of sign-up ideas, trading bonuses, and refer-a-friend deals. Thus, some sites can provide free crypto for their customers if they perform some simple tasks. Other options include shopping rewards with credit cards, referral bonuses, playing games, and participating in trading competitions. 

This article will explore twenty easy ways to earn free crypto without much preparation. 

## Best Ways To Earn Free Bitcoins In Your Wallet

### 1. Signing Up With An Exchange

Several crypto exchanges reward their new clients with free coins if they sign up as a client. This option is the easiest and safest on our list and, honestly, the quickest to get. For example, Gemini gives $25 BTC to new UK users who trade $100 in the first three days.

The most popular exchange platform that offers free crypto are:

* Coinbase
* Gemini
* [BlockFi](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/gemini-review/)
* Celsius
* Crypto.com

You also should monitor some other exchange platforms as sometimes they offer free crypto options and ​​provide time-sensitive bonuses. 

### 2. Crypto Staking

In a nutshell, staking is how many cryptocurrencies verify their transactions, allowing crypto-investors to earn rewards on their holdings. This process involves committing your crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. But I must warn you that you can do so only with cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-stake model to process payments.  

### 3. Play Games And Get Free Bitcoin

The best crypto games work the same as classic video games, except they are hosted on the blockchain rather than game consoles. Many online games reward small amounts of bitcoin as a prize. The games work equally to bitcoin faucets.

The bitcoin bonuses encourage investors and users to play games and view ads. Plus, the games provide myriad benefits, most notably, the ability to use cryptocurrency within the game for specific tasks. The reward amount tends to be pretty low. But it is still worth trying.

For example, [Lucky Block](https://www.luckyblock.com/) is building a crypto game around a number-drawing process. If your number is chosen from the random daily draw, you can win a percentage of the jackpot prize. Now, to buy a ticket to enter the interest costs $5 – payable in the project's native digital token, LBlock.

But Lucky Block offers the opportunity to earn a free ticket, meaning you can bypass the $5 requirement. You need to hold an allocation of LBlock tokens and connect your private wallet to the Lucky Block app each day.

### 4. Earn A Return On Bitcoin That You Already Have In Your Wallet

Do you already hold bitcoin within a crypto portfolio? Great! That means some crypto products allow you to generate a yield from your assets. If you have some coins in your wallet, check if your exchange offers a way to earn an annual percentage yield (APY) on your digital assets. 

Usually, people associate bitcoin with a Proof-of-Work blockchain. Lending or "off-chain staking" is one of the most common options. Yield-generating products typically include on-chain staking for Proof-of-Stake blockchains and lending products where digital assets are lent to third parties to generate a return on investment.

### 5. Refer A Friend

Sometimes you want to avoid signing up for a new exchange, so another option is to recommend your exchange to a friend. Loads of affiliate programs are widely available in the cryptocurrency industry.

For example, you can earn free Bitcoin instantly by applying for the [Binance bitcoin referral program](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/referral/offers). You can refer your friends, giving you 20% when they make a transaction. Your friend also gets a 20% discount.

Such resources as [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/refer-a-friend) and [Kriptomat](https://kriptomat.io/referral-program/) now offer excellent bonuses of Bitcoin if you refer someone. In this case, you both get a bonus. The [eToro’s referral program](https://www.etoro.com/invite/) also presently provides $50 for referrals.

### 6. Get Bitcoin Cashback On Your Shopping

Like shopping? Now you can not only spend your money but also earn free bitcoin by shopping online with the help of shopping reward companies. Several browser extensions and web browsers now allow you to earn bitcoin rewards if you do some tasks online. Shopping with partner retailers can also help bolster your bitcoin holdings over time. 

For example, the [app Lolli](https://www.lolli.com/mobile) gives you free Bitcoin when you shop for over 1000 top stores. For that, you need to download this app.

### 7. Free NFTs

A non-fungible token, or NFT, is also a digital asset considered an artwork. NFTs have become extremely popular over the last couple of years. Some of them can cost a fortune! 

There are several ways you can get some free NFTs. First, some new crypto projects on the market may offer NFTs as an "invite bonus" to their top supporters. Such resources as [Freecash.com](https://freecash.com) can provide information on free NTFs for its users. You could follow new crypto on its Discord channel and wait for an invite bonus pool for the people who drive the most traffic to the channel. 

The second way is to use Twitter, where you can find regular NFTs giveaways, which a project team can reward you for promotion.

### 8. Crypto Lending

Another way to earn some free coins is crypto lending. It is a process of depositing your crypto that you lent out to some borrowers in return for regular interest payments. 

There are two main types of crypto lending that crypto platforms offer. The first one is decentralised crypto lenders. The second one is centralised crypto lenders. Both offer access to high-interest rates, sometimes up to 15 - 20% annual yield (APY). But crypto loans are pretty risky because margin calls may happen if asset prices drop.

### 9. Cashback In Crypto

We are all used to cashback options from our banks. A similar option is provided by [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/), which launched its "Bitcoin Cashback" in 2020. There are two ways that you can make some free Bitcoin using CoinCorner. You can browse its directory of online retailers and shop as usual. Or you also can download its bitcoin cashback extension and receive a pop-up when you visit a partner retailer site so that you will be notified of bitcoin cashback offers. These partner retailers include B&Q, Schuh, Boots, and Curry PC World.

### 10. Five Platforms That Give You Free Crypto

### 11. Bitcoin Mining Pool

Some popular pools are [Slush Pool](https://braiins.com/pool) or [F2pool](https://www.f2pool.com).

Secondly, you can use a website that facilitates online freelancing and accepts cryptocurrency payments, for example, [XBitFreelancer.](https://xbtfreelancer.net/) But also, please be careful as there are plenty of scams and fraudulent activities.
