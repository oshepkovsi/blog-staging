We’re glad to inform our advertisers that we’ve implemented the support of altcoins for deposits. 



Now we accept deposits in Ripple, Binance Coin, Bitcoin SV, Tether, NEO, Ether Classic, Tron, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, ZCash, NEM and Waves.



We plan to add support of other cryptocurrencies as well.



You are welcome to use the option. There are a few things to keep in mind, though.



First of all, we automatically convert your altcoin deposits to Bitcoin (BTC), which is our primary currency. All the financial calculations will be in Bitcoin.



Secondly, there is a 3% conversion fee for altcoin deposits, and [our payment processor](https://www.coinpayments.net/) will take an additional 0.5% fee (1% for ERC20 and BEP20 tokens).



Thirdly, altcoin deposits will not be displayed until they are confirmed. Since we use a third party to accept altcoins, it may take additional time to process the payment after it receives the required amount of confirmations (which depends on the currency).
