Good news for our users, we now support Bech32 addresses for bitcoin withdrawals!

Bech32 is a native bitcoin address format for SegWit (Segregated Witness, a protocol upgrade activated in August 2017 to increase Bitcoin capacity).

SegWit transactions take less space inside a block, which allows more transactions per block and improves transaction confirmation times.

When you spend from Bech32 addresses, you can count on [a 38% reduction of transaction fees](https://blog.blockonomics.co/saving-transaction-fee-using-segwit-how-to-be-a-bitcoin-ninja-78d8416375db) (compared to spending from legacy non-SegWit addresses).

Surprisingly, as of June 28, 2019, [less than 50% of bitcoin transactions use SegWit](https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments/segwit). Can you imagine the amount of unoptimized block space?

We invite you to specify a Bech32 address in your withdrawal settings and join us in saving on fees while improving Bitcoin throughput!

**Please mind that most exchanges still do not provide their users with bech32/segwit addresses. More information on** [**this page**](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption)**.**
