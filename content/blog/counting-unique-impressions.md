If you [want to become our publisher](https://a-ads.com/ad_units/new), you might be interested to learn what we mean by "unique impressions".

* One IP address can generate only 1 unique impression in the scope of the whole network during a day. This impression will be considered unique as it comes from a visitor who hasn't seen our ads for the past 24 hours. And this visitor won't generate another unique impression during this day, no matter what sites he visits and what ads he sees.
* If there are several ad units on one page, only one of them will receive a unique impression upon page load (the one which loads first). 
* Also, if your ad unit is of type "Site", then only impressions that go from the site domain or its subdomains will be considered unique.

This makes our stats incompatible with Google Analytics or any other web visitors counting services. Our numbers will always be less for the same traffic.

But hereâ€™s the good news: we are neither a pay-per-impression nor a pay-per-click network. Your earnings depend not on the absolute amount of unique impressions, but on the share of the network-wide unique impressions that you generate. So absolute numbers don't mean much.
