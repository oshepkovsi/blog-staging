Are you dreaming of working in the crypto industry and getting your salary in bitcoins? I have great news for you! Cryptocurrency careers are more popular now than you think.

These jobs are not necessarily related to computers or technology. Yes, some jobs require hard technical skills like programming, cryptography, financial analysis, and engineering. But there are plenty of other nontechnical vacancies for which even writers and designers can find the right jobs. Sometimes, you even can get a job in crypto with no experience. 

Companies and organizations that use or create cryptocurrency employ people with marketing, managing, writing, and business development skills. 

## Are Cryptocurrency Jobs Real?

This article will look through the most popular job types in the crypto industry and tell you how to get a job in crypto. Just pick the most relevant to you and start preparing your CV! 

## Types of Crypto Jobs

Technical writers create content about complex technical topics in a way that's easily understood. They are like translators, from complicated technical language to a more straightforward language that people without a crypto background can understand. The responsibilities of a technical writer usually include researching the best way to present the information and working with technical professionals to ensure accuracy and comprehensibility. Technical writers give information for things like brochures, manuals, or blog articles. They often work with a project's marketing team to develop a tone of voice, brand image, or business presentations. Technical writers may also proofread and edit other writers' work.

### 2. Marketing Manager 

Another job that doesn't require hard technical skills. A marketing manager develops an organization's marketing policies and works on marketing campaigns. They often work with advertising and promotional managers to plan events, analyze data to determine strategies, create estimates for campaign costs and potential sales and evaluate the success of marketing campaigns. Marketing managers also work with technical and financial teams when developing marketing strategies for the currency they use.
