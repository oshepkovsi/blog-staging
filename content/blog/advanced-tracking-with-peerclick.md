**5. Configure your A-ADS campaign.**\
Set your A-ADS campaign link to your PeerClick campaign URL without the “?” and everything after it.

For example: http://1355671696.gopeerclick.com/15Gptd

Then set your A-ADS campaign’s goal tracking suffix to the “?” and everything after.

For example:

```
“?partner={{partner}}&device_type={{device_type}}&browser_name={{browser_name}}&os_name={{os_name}}&http_country_code={{http_country_code}}&http_accept_language={{http_accept_language}}&ip_address={{ip_address}}&ad_unit={{ad_unit}}&banner_size={{banner_size}}&external_id={{timestamp}}?partner={{partner}}&device_type={{device_type}}&browser_name={{browser_name}}&os_name={{os_name}}&http_country_code={{http_country_code}}&http_accept_language={{http_accept_language}}&ip_address={{ip_address}}&ad_unit={{ad_unit}}&banner_size={{banner_size}}&external_id={{timestamp}}&os_version={{os_version}}”
```
