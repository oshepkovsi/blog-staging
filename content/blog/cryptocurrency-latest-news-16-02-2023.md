## Siemens has issued a Eurobond on the Polygon blockchain

The [bond was issued using blockchain](https://blockworks.co/news/german-conglomerate-siemens-issues-e60m-digital-bond-on-polygon) technology to streamline the issuance process and reduce costs. German engineering company Siemens is not the first to issue a bond using blockchain technology, but one of the first to give a bond denominated in euros. Other companies, such as the World Bank and Societe Generale, have previously issued bonds using blockchain technology.

The use of blockchain technology for issuing bonds is expected to become more widespread in the future, as it offers many advantages over traditional issuance methods.

Siemens has been studying blockchain technology for several years and has invested in several blockchain-based startups. The company is also a member of the Energy Web Foundation, a non-profit organization that develops blockchain-based solutions for the energy sector.

## Have you already tried ChatGPT?

[Binance thinks](https://finbold.com/binance-says-chatgpt-could-help-crypto-adoption-heres-how/) that this text-based artificial intelligence platform can help crypto adoption. Some options are:

* writing a rap song about crypto
* producing human-like responses to questions about blockchain
* or "helping to clarify concepts interactively and conversationally."

## Surprisingly, Blockchain Avalanche showed growth of transactions by 1500%!

In 2022, despite the bankruptcies of major market players and the decrease in the cost of tokens by almost 15 times, the number of transactions exceeded 450 million. It is 1507% more than in 2021.

An increase in transactions with [Avalanche-based NFTs partly drove](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/14/avalanche-blockchain-saw-1500-transactional-growth-in-2022-nansen/) the increase in volumes. The network is recovering and ready for new projects, said research analyst Nansen.

## Cardano's "Valentine" upgrades 

Cardano developers [are about to create cross-chain decentralized](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/15/cardano-gets-valentine-upgrade-heres-how-it-benefits-ada-token/) applications that are secure, cost-effective, and give access to a broader range of services. The team has launched a valentine upgrade for its Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SECP) primitives on the network's mainnet. The group said such an upgrade also helps improve security and interoperability features on the Cardano blockchain.
