### How Does Crypto Interest Work?

Let's explore the four simple steps to begin earning interest:

1. **Open A Crypto Account**

First, you need to make a platform that allows you to earn some interest and open an account there. If you already have an account, check if your platform allows its users to generate some income. 

For example, BlockFi is a good option if you're a beginner in cryptocurrency. You can connect your BlockFi account with your bank account to purchase crypto with cash. The platform currently offers an 8.6% annual interest rate compounded monthly, depending on which cryptocurrency you use.

2. **Rates Comparison** 

Your next step is to compare the interest rates of different platforms. 

It all depends if the company takes a cut of the interest or not. Thus, your interest rate may vary significantly, even if you invest in the same cryptocurrency.

What to consider a reasonable interest rate? Well, usually, it is between 6% to 9% for stablecoins. Some platforms offer interest rates over 100%. But this is where you should be careful, as such high rates are indicators of high volatility and risk. So, be skeptical. 

3. **Add Coins To Your Portfolio**

If you make an account with a platform that only accepts deposits in cryptocurrency, you'll need to create an account with a crypto exchange. Many crypto investors choose cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, eToro, or Binance. When you buy crypto through one of these exchanges, you can send it to your crypto wallet address on the chosen platform.

4. **Earn Interest**

You'll earn interest once you have added funds to your interest account. Just watch your savings grow. 

## Crypto Savings Accounts Vs. Crypto Wallets

We need to clarify one important thing: a crypto savings account and a crypto wallet are different. They may sound alike, but the difference is the ability to earn interest. 

When you keep your money in a cryptocurrency savings account, it will generate interest in the future. When you keep your coins in a wallet with keys that only you have, your investment will not earn interest. It means that the number of coins in your wallet will remain the same if you don't withdraw them.

But the brilliant news is that thanks to technology, some wallets let you earn interest in cryptocurrencies. So you can both store your coins and earn some interest. 

Quick coin access is why many investors prefer wallets over saving accounts. They want to have complete control over their money. But if you invest using a cryptocurrency savings account, you give the account provider permission to loan out your initial investment. The account provider might limit when you can withdraw your coins. If you need quick access to your cryptocurrency investment, keep your crypto in a wallet then. 

## Conclusion 

A cryptocurrency savings account can be a great appeal and bring you attractive returns if your investments are long-term. But remember, that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and doesn't have the same financial protections as banking institutions.
