Firstly, info on "Goal tracking" and how to switch it on [here](https://a-ads.com/blog/2019-10-16-why-do-i-need-goal-tracking-how-to-switch-it-on/).\
Most, or all of our tracking tokens are self-explanatory but for elaboration and easy understanding the following article will briefly explain the values of the tokens.

\* `{{partner}}`

This token is the most popular, and to some users, the most important, it denotes {campaign\_ID}\_{ad_unit_ID}.

e.g. `12345_67890`

Where 12345 is equal to campaign ID and 67890 is equal to ad unit ID.

\* `{{timestamp}}`

This token indicates the exact time the ad was clicked. This is simple [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)

E.g. `1613148215`

You can convert the value to normal time using [Epoch converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/)
