## **Who Are Crypto Influencers?**

The surveys show that despite crypto hype, [32% of US adults](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/many-us-adults-dont-trust-cryptocurrency) don't trust crypto, and 25% don't understand crypto. Plus, regulations are constantly changing, market patterns are unpredictable, and an invasion of scammers are just a few of the complex concerns that potential investors must contend with.

It means that advertising crypto projects can't be easy as consumers may know nothing about them or don't trust them.

In this case influencers can help. People trust influencer recommendations more than celebrities or a banner because influencers are more relatable. Crypto influencers can make complex concerns understandable to those not technically trained. 

To see your crypto project take off, establish credibility and trust. Brands that have launched successful crypto projects can attest to this. And there's no better way to do this than influencer marketing. 

### What Makes A Crypto Influencer Strategy Effective? 

**1. Trust** 

Some research shows that ROI from Crypto influencer marketing is higher than from other forms of online growth methods.

*The larger portion of marketers believes that influencer marketing brings a comparable return on investment. 14% believe that it brings much better ROI and 34% rate influencer marketing ROI as better. On the other side, 10% of marketers think it’s worse and 1% rate it as much worse compared to other channels. (Source: Smart Insights)*

The main reason for that is simply trusted. Crypto influencers have built their reputation, and people trust their opinions. They may have a relatively small but more committed community of followers, more accessible and more important to engage with.

**2. Influencer Programs Increase Organic Interest**

Advertising campaigns are created to improve brand recognition and raise brand awareness. In comparison, influencer programs increase organic interest and motivate community growth by establishing a company's reputation. 

**3. Influencers Bring A More Involved Audience** 

It is even more critical for smaller projects or start-ups that are new on the market and have no audience yet. Crypto influencers share information on a business or product with their audience, which is already prepared to pay attention. As one of the marketing laws says, clients are more inclined to interact with content if provided by someone with whom they are eager to connect. 

### Some Drawbacks Of Crypto Influencer Marketing

**1. No Results Are Guaranteed** 

Influencer marketing is a pretty volatile form of promotion. Choosing the right influencer for the right project is not an easy task to do. You should carefully select which content creator's audience performs the best for your product or services. Thus, start investing small sums across a large number of influencers. 

**2. It Is An Expensive Strategy** 

Trust is not cheap, which means crypto influencer marketing is generally more expensive than other forms of paid advertising.

### **How To Choose The Right Influencer For My Project?**

Before choosing one, do the following: 

* **Identify Your Goals**

Who is your target audience, and what are your specific goals? 

* **Calculate The Budget** 

Determine how much money you want to spend on short-term and long-term strategies. 

* **Use Social Platforms To Search For Influencers Manually**

You can use Google to find listicles of the best crypto influencers. Another way is = to work with a crypto marketing agency to develop, manage and monitor your entire influencer campaign.

* **Check The Audience Of The Chosen Influencer**

Is this audience suitable for your project? Ideally, it is best to focus on audiences typically interested in sub-crypto topics such as NFTs, DeFi, Securities, Exchanges, etc.

* **Do Your Own Research**

Research the agency or influencer and make sure they are respected and ethical. It is essential to look at the number of followers and posts of the influencers.
